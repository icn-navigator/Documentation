## Summary

### Presentation

Summary of the presentation Harry gave at the start of the tutorial
#TODO maybe ask Harry for the slides. 

**Steps of requirements analysis process

1) Stakeholder Identification (done)
2) Elicitation of requirements
3) Documentation of requirements
4) Analysis and Negotiation
5) Validation and verification

#### **Requirement analysis** (steps 2 and 3)

Given the list of requirements we'll:
* Break down into what's in scope
* Break down into function vs non-functional requirements
* Break down into **user stories**
* Discussion/feedback from requirements with clients

User stories form a **backlog**:
* These will be broken into **product backlog** (all)
* And a **sprint backlog** (subset just for that sprint - chosen carefully)

##### User Stories

Consist of:
* Priority (assignment should be decided with the client - important for sprint planning)
* Story Point (quantify how much work it is - important property: relative scale)
* Due Date
* Assignee
* Status 
* Acceptance Criteria
* Reviewer

##### Epic 

Is an approach to breaking down and focussing on features. They operate at a higher level about user-stories. User-stories are assigned to an Epic. E.g., Maps might be an epic. 

**Technology:**
* You can automate and nicely organise a lot of these processes using software. Harry explained this for Jira, we should figure out the best workflows on GitHub.

**Summary:**

* Defined how to achieve Sprint Goal (design)
* Create Sprint Backlog (User Stories) from Product
* Estimate Sprint Backlog using team velocity and Story Point estimates (e.g. Alice can complete 10 SP's in a sprint, Bob can complete 5.)
* Product Owner priority guides the work (e.g. priority assignment)
* Release Plan is created
* High-level design is considered

**Final Doc (Exemplar from past year)**

He wen't over an absolutely CRACKED final document. Here is some general structure:

* Table with decision making
* Communication (e.g. schedule meeting meetings - different types of meeting e.g. client meetings)
* Sprint planning
* Sprint review
* Sprint retrospective
	* What we did well
	* What we could do bette
* External communication (e.g. emails sent, prototypes sent and feedback from client)
* Architecture documentation (functional and non-functional requirments)
	* DCD
	* Database Diagram
	* Architecture Diagram (don't forget to include deployment platform)
* Product brief 
	* Market analysis
* Frontend
	* Storybook for documentation of frontend components 
	* Webflow routing (user flow diagram)
* Backend
	* Research (on tech stack, on authentication)
	* API doc (use Swagger - automatic for the endpoints etc. )
		* Table for the different methods (what the response messages mean etc.)
* Feedback 
	* Supervisor feedback
	* Peer feedback
* Epic and User stories
	* Every user story linked to a jira ticket (priority / story point)
	* Cancelling user stories is ok
	* Rules for creating new user stories
		* Types of tickets ( development, feature request, bug report, impprovements, chores)
		* Ticket components 
* Code and Repo standard
	* Naming conventions
	* Guide on Prettier Linter
	* GitHub conventions (branching etc. / pull request workflow)
	* Backend / front end file structure
* Handover document
	* Features
	* Features by sprint
	* Frontend Design
	* Product Overview and Stakeholder Information
	* Known Issues and Future Works
	* For developers
	* Change Logs
	* Authentication and Authorisation
	* Demo Video

## Action Items

* Chase up Harry about the requirements document (can't really start until we have this)
* Documentation
	* Backfill stuff like decision making
	* Start on the architecture documents
	* Researching tech stack and justifying/comparing choices?
* Setting up documentation very cleanly (perhaps think about how we might deploy it)

## Next Meeting

* Tuesday after MOC?
