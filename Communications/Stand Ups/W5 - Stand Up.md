### Oliver

**Focus**
* Getting things together for the [[Progress Checklist]] with a primary focus on **artefacts**

**What's done?**
* Wrote a draft of the [[Requirement Breakdown]]
* Draft of [[high-level-sys-arch.pdf]]
* Draft of [[wireframe-app-setup.pdf]]
* General obsidian tidy-up (added more draft decision records)

**What's next?**
* Organise team review of the Requirement Breakdown (possibly clients too?) 
* Team review for the high-level-sys-architecture (especially with @Julian for backend technologies)
* Review wireframe with team -> work on getting to a finalsed mockup/prototype stage ready for coding
* Continue making sure the team is on track for the progress checklist

**Blockers?**
* Still a bit sure on the best way to go about contacting the clients
* Don't wan't to go to far ahead on some of these things with out team/client feedback
* Not really a blocker, but would love to see more people using the Obsidian vault.
## Questions

* What is the best way to contact the clients? (Where is the Google Doc?)
