## Review

**Documentation Note:** After [[W4 - Stand Up]] we decided to move away from the table format, so we can more easily include more information for the Stand-Up review. 

### Zoy

Please note that Zoy had an exam the week this stand-up corresponds to, so that limited her work output on this project. 

**Focus**
* Research

**What's done?**
* Research? 

**What's next?**
* Seek team member help for what to do next 

**Blockers?**
*  Some uncertainty on what to work on that will best help the team

### Alex

**Focus**
* Front-end prototype 

**What's done?**
* Desktop UI (specifically maps) 

**What's next?**
* Continue
* Help in areas the team needs help

**Blockers?**
* None 

### Matthew

**Focus**
* Figma UI design (high-fidelity)

**What's done?**
* Working on the map filtering UI
* Decisions relating to broader map UI

**What's next?**
* Work on getting frontend codebase setup 

**Blockers?**
* Struggled to come up with good icons for the different types of map UI 

### Julian

**Focus**
* Documentation deployment
* Backend design

**What's done?**
* Compiling the Obsidian to the web
	* Tested with Jekyll 
	* Landed on [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as it's more Obsidian-specific
	* Got this working locally (identified need for `index` file)
* Researched backend design 

**What's next?**
* Finish Quartz setup
	* Set up [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions?utm_source=chatgpt.com) workflow to run on `push` events to the documentation branch and deploy updated site automatically
* Research backend
	* May work on getting AWS services set up 	
	* Document some backend choices

**Blockers?**
* None 
### Oliver

**Focus**
* Getting things together for the [[Progress Checklist]] with a primary focus on **artefacts**

**What's done?**
* Wrote a draft of the [[Requirement Breakdown]]
* Draft of [[high-lvl-system-arch.pdf]]
* Draft of [[wireframe-app-setup.pdf]]
* General obsidian tidy-up (added more draft decision records)

**What's next?**
* Organise team review of the Requirement Breakdown (possibly clients too?) 
* Team review for the high-level-sys-architecture (especially with @Julian for backend technologies)
* Review wireframe with team -> work on getting to a finalised mockup/prototype stage ready for coding
* Continue to make sure the team is on track for the progress checklist

**Blockers?**
* Still a bit sure on the best way to go about contacting the clients
* Don't wan't to go to far ahead on some of these things with out team/client feedback
* Not really a blocker, but would love to see more people using the Obsidian vault!
## Questions

* What is the best way to contact the clients? (Where is the Google Doc?) 
	* ANS: It's been setup but not shared with us yet (waiting client confirmation)
