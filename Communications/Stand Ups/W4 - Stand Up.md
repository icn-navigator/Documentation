## Additional Notes

It sounds like we're not going to get the client's promised requirement document anytime soon. In accordance with Harry's suggestion, we'll just continue with what we think the App should be - that's the best we can do. 

## Questions

* Do we need use case diagrams?

## Action Items

- [ ] Architecture Diagrams 
- [ ] Sprint Planning Documentation
- [ ] Properly fill backlog (at least up to first sprint items)
- [ ] Team meeting to assign tasks / priority and estimates to backlog items
- [ ] More documentation in general
