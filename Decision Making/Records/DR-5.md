## Background

We need to discuss a Map API to use

## Relevant Data

- I (Matthew) have used MapBox API in the past before for work. However we still need to confirm to use as commercial usage may require a subscription. Depending how much traffic it receives.
## Options Considered

- Leaflet - Does not provide its own map tiles, but very light weight and has a low learning curve.
- Mapbox - commercial usage requires subscription, allows for more feature rich features. Good for large scale data but slightly higher learning curve.
## Action items

- [ ] Seek further feedback from all developers involved in frontend code (likely the whole team) to see what they are the most comfortable with

--- 
## Outcome

Mapbox
