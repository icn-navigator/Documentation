## Background

We need a tool for task management to keep track of who is doing what and when. Aligns with the Agile methodology. 
## Relevant Data

We want something simple and easy to use.
## Options Considered

### Jira

**Positives:**
* Feature rich
* Integration with GitHub
* Integration with Confluence
* Industry standard

**Negatives:**
* Perhaps a bit bloated
* Learning curve
* Not free for all features

### GitHub Projects

**Positives:**
* Direct integration with GitHub
* Still relatively feature rich

**Negatives:**
* Learning curve
* Relatively new (Released in 2024)
* Not specifically tailored for the Scrum / Agile workflow, but can be made to do so (see [Scrum with GitHub Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06AWiNvjlQU))
## Action items

- [m] Check with Harry that using GitHub projects is OK.

--- 
## Outcome

We will be using GitHub projects. 

* Unlike [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction#dig-into-specific-features), Projects is not commonly used on an industry scale, but has many similar core features and should be effective for a small team of 5
* (Hopefully) easier to learn
