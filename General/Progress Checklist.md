**NOTE:** This is version [[progress-checklist.pdf]] adapted for markdown for ease of updates. However, the final version should be submitted as a PDF using that template. Also, this version uses internal links. **Before submission** this should be updated to external links (In most cases, hopefully to these notes but on a website!). 

**DUE:** Sunday, September 7th by 23:59 on [Canvas](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/211713/assignments/580073).

Also see the [[progress-checklist-marking.pdf]] which provides a **marking key** and establishes clear expectations!
